# Freeware: WatcomC++ 11.0 repository with a dream interpretation database

This is just for fun and nothing serious for most people. I just scanned the "Didymos Lexikon der Traumsymbole für das Millennium" and made a very simple interface for it. If you are german and want to know what your brain is doing the night, maybe this database is worth a look. But for most people: Don't mind this repository.
